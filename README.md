# Collaborative Agents solving Two-Player Puzzle Game

This Unity project focuses on the development of AI for two autonomous agents designed to solve puzzle mini-games through cooperation. The game itself, including the levels and actions, was first developed as a foundation, with the puzzles specifically created to be solved by two players working together.

The main goal of this project was to create intelligent agents capable of collaborating to complete these challenges as efficiently as possible.

## Features
- **AI-driven Cooperative Agents**: Two autonomous agents that solve puzzles through collaboration.
- **Puzzle Mini-Games**: Custom-designed levels requiring teamwork to solve.
- **Unity Engine**: Built using Unity, ensure you have it installed to run the project.

## Demo
The demo video, located in the `Demo` folder, features a run of each level being solved by the agents. After each run, the timer and the number of actions taken are briefly displayed. These metrics were the main evaluation criteria used to assess the agents' performance.

## Report
The report in the `Report` folder details the problem setup, the development process of the game and agents, and includes an empirical evaluation of the results based on the agents' performance in solving the puzzles.
